# Chat Application using socket.io

The app is a part of my **#30Days30Projects challenge**. The app have a nice UI which shows a notification on user joined and leaved event. Multiple users can join the chat at a time.

The public folder contains the client side stuff while the server side code is in `index.js` file. The demo is available [here](https://codepen.io/sheikh_ishaan/full/vYEazXa)

## Usage

- clone the repository

        git clone <>

- Install dependencies
    
       npm install

- Run socket.io server

        npm run dev

- Open `public/index.html` in **multiple tabs**. You'll see a notification each time the user connected.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js (Express.js)
- [Socket.io](http://socket.io)
- Vanilla JavaScript
